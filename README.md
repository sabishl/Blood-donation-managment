**Project Name:** Blood Donation Management System

**Technologies Used:** Flutter, Firebase

**Project Overview:**
The Blood Donation Management System is a mobile application
designed to facilitate blood donation and request services. The application enables users to
sign up by providing essential details such as name, email, blood group, password, and
address. These details are securely stored in Firebase.
Once registered, users can log in to access the home page, which features an overview of
blood donation requests, donor acceptance details, the user’s profile picture, and username.
The home page also includes an app bar for easy navigation.

**Features:**

** Blood Donation Requests:** Users can view and accept donation requests. Upon
acceptance, the details of the person requesting blood are displayed to the donor.

** Blood Request Form:** Users can create a new blood request by filling out a form
with necessary details, including blood group, address, patient name, and age. This
request is then sent to other users with the matching blood group.

**Challenges:**

** Location Tracking:** Implementing location tracking requires the integration of a paid
API, which poses a financial challenge.

** Message Sending:** Sending alert messages to users also incurs costs, adding another
layer of financial consideration.
